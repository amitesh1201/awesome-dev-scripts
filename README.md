# 🚀 Awesome Dev Scripts

Welcome to `awesome-dev-scripts`\! This repository is a personal collection of useful scripts written in various languages (Python, Bash, and more) to streamline common development tasks, automate workflows, and generally make life a little easier.

-----

## ✨ Why This Repo Exists

As developers, we often find ourselves performing repetitive tasks, whether it's setting up a new project, managing cloud resources, or performing system maintenance. This repo aims to:

  * **Centralize Reusable Code:** Keep frequently used scripts in one accessible place.
  * **Boost Productivity:** Automate mundane tasks so we can focus on what truly matters: coding.
  * **Share Knowledge:** Provide examples and tools that might be helpful to other developers facing similar challenges.

## 🛠️ How To Use

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/awesome-dev-scripts.git
    cd awesome-dev-scripts
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Script:**
    Browse the directories to find a script that fits your needs (e.g., `cd python/lvm_manager`).
3.  **Read the Script's `README.md` (if available):**
    Many subdirectories or individual scripts will have their own `README.md` file providing specific usage instructions, prerequisites, and examples.
4.  **Execute:**
      * **Python:** `python3 script_name.py [arguments]`
      * **Bash:** `./script_name.sh [arguments]` (ensure it's executable with `chmod +x script_name.sh`)
      * **Other Languages:** Consult the script's specific documentation.

## ⚠️ Important Notes & Best Practices

  * **Permissions:** Some scripts (especially Bash and system-level Python scripts) may require **superuser privileges (`sudo`)** to run. Always understand what a script does before executing it with elevated permissions.
  * **Dependencies:** Python scripts may have dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt` file within their respective directories. Install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  * **Backup Your Data:** For scripts that modify your system or data, **always perform a backup first.** I'm not responsible for any data loss that may occur from using these scripts.
  * **Review Code:** Before running any script from this repository (or any external source), **review its code** to understand its functionality and ensure it aligns with your intentions.
  * **Contribution:** While this is primarily a personal collection, I welcome suggestions\! If you have an idea for a script or a major improvement, feel free to open an issue.
